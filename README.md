# US Ski Areas and Cities

### Corin Zarkowski

I created this map with the intent of creating a tool to assist both experienced and novice skiers in familiarizing themselves with United States ski areas and their relative distances to major cities. Tools included in the web map include sliders to adjust what ski areas are visible, based on both popularity (Wikipedia pageviews), and total vertical drop, a menu to select the basis of circle scaling between popularity and vertical, and a filter to only show cities with a given amount of ski areas in a given radius.

With these tools, users can view trends in both ski area location and general vertical. For example, on initial viewing of the map, one might see the giant cluster of areas in the northeast and assume it to be the centerpiece of United States skiing. However, when the filters are applied for popularity and vertical, a large amount of ski areas in the northeast disappear while the clusters in the west become more prenounced. Using the city filter can allow the user to determine ski access from different US cities. An avid skier looking to move across the United States might look for a large amount of ski areas in a close radius, while a more casual skier might such search for a single opportunity to ski in a larger radius.
